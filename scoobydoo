Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?

We've got some work to do now

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?

We need some help from you now

Come on, Scooby Doo, I see you

Pre-tending you got a sliver

But you're not fooling me cause I can see

The way you shake and shiver...

You know we got a mystery to solve

So, Scooby Doo, be ready for your act!

Don't hold back! And Scooby Doo, if you come through

You'll have yourself a Scooby snack. That's a fact!

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, here are you.

You're ready and you're willing.

If we can count on you, Scooby Doo,

I know you'll catch that villain.
